##### Authentication Methods
---
**Directory Services**: Central database that stored all usernames & passwords of an organization.
- Distributed across machines & services, but will constantly communicate and update each other.
- All authentication requests reference this directory, so each user only need a set of credentials to access to all services within the network.
- Microsoft's Active Directory (AD)
	- Use Kerberos' protocol or LDAP to access that database from external device

**Federation**: Allow others to authenticate using accounts from a third party.
- E.g., Sign in with Google.
- **Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)**: Open standard for authentication and authorization.
	- Outdated, as not good on mobile device.
- **OAuth**: Authorization framework. Only decide what application can be accessed.
	- **OpenID Connect** is used for authentication (SSO)
	
- **Relying Parties (RP)**: Service provider in federation (intended service to use.)
- **Identity Provider (IdP)**: Provide identity information of the user (e.g., Google when logging in LinkedIn.)
	- Usually same as **Security Token Service (STS)**

**Attestation**: Prove the hardware is trustworthy and authentic, belongs to your organization.
- Remote attestation: automated process of attestation for remote device.
- Devices should send an attestation report (encrypted and signed with the Trusted Module Platform (TPM, a hardware security device, commonly used by BitLocker)) to prove its identity
- An IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) or other unique hardware components can be included into that report.

**Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)**: hashing by combining secret key & current time.
- Secret key is initiated in the first time setup of the 2FA. Current time is the nouce (random number). Usually changed every 30 seconds.
- Thus, the app and the server will use both the secret key & the current time to create a hash, and use the last 6 digit of the hash as the 6-digit OTP.

**HMAC One-Time Password (HOTP)**: hashing by combining secret key & Counter
- HMAC: Hash-based Message Authentication Code
- Similar to TOTP, but the random number / moving factor is a counter (counts number of iteration)


**SMS Authentication**: NIST recommends to deprecate SMS as they can not be encrypted, thus is accessible to attackers.



##### Biometrics
---
**Gait analysis**: Identify how a person walk.

**False Acceptance Rate (FAR)**: False positive of biometrics -> accept fake -> not sensitive enough
**False Rejection Rate (FRR)**: False negative of biometrics -> rejecting true -> too sensitive

**Crossover Error Rate (CER)**: Overall accuracy of biometrics -> point of intersection between FAR & FRR (Lowest error, good sensitivity)

##### Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
---
**AAA Framework (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting)**:
- Identification: Who are you? Usually account name.
- Authentication: Are you really who you are? Password.
- Authorization: Based on your identity, what access do you have?
- Accounting: Logging the login & logout activities

**Multi-factor Authentication:** Either Factors or Attributes (AHK,CAKE)
- 3 Factors (Closely link to the individual)
	- Something you **a**re (Biometrics)
	- Something you **h**ave (Items you own, e.g. keycard, USB token, token)
	- Something you **k**now (in your brain, e.g. password, PIN)
- 4 Attributes (Helps with authentication process)
	- Something you **c**an do (E.g., signature)
	- Somewhere you **a**re (GPS location, IP address)
	- Someone you **k**now (Social factor, e.g., a digital signature from a trusted source)
	- Something you **e**xhibit (How you walk / type. behavioral pattern)
