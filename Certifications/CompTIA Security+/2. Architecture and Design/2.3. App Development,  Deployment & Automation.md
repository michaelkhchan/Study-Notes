##### Secure Deployment
---
**Environment:**
- Development 
- Test
- Staging / Sandbox
- Production 
- Quality assurance (QA)

**Integrity Measurement**: Check to see if the application instances are following the secure baselines. (Usually related to configurations, versions, and levels.)


##### Provisioning and Deprovisioning
---
**Orchestration**: Automation of provisioning and deprovisioning of services and application instances.


##### Secured Coding Techniques
---
**Stored Procedures**: Instead of allowing user inputting complex requests, store the pre-defined requests in the server and only allow clients to choose from the list.
- To avoid user-input-related injection.

##### Software Diversity
---
**Software Diversity**: Creates applications that are functional identical but binary-code-wise different by compiling each applications with a different binary file.
- If an attacker created an exploit for one application based on binary, it will not be transferrable to other pieces of application.
- However this requires extra time and effort as you need to create multiple copies of the same application.

##### Automation and Scripting
---
**Continuous Integration**: constantly merging new codes into the central repository.
**Continuous Delivery**: Automate testing and release process -> one-click deploy.
**Continuous Deployment**: Automate deploy to production. No human integration & manual checks.
