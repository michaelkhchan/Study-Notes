##### Integrity
---
**Provenance**: Origin source of information.
- A documented trail of the origin of data to where it is present.
- Provide authenticity, integrity and confidence to the data.
- Provide a chain of custody.

##### Managing Evidence
---
**E-discovery**: A legal mechanism used to gather digital evidence.
- Gathers data required by the legal process.


##### Digital Forensics
---
**Legal Holds**: Legal requirement to preserve relevant information.
- Electronically stored information (ESI)

**Chain of Custody**: A chain of who contacts the evidence.


##### Forensics Data Acquisition
---
**Order of Volatility**: Some media is much more volatile and data will be gone if not kept quickly.

| Volatilility | Media |
| ---- | ---- |
| Highest | **CPU Registers, CPU Caches (L1, L2, L3)**<br><br>*CPU Register is a small, super fast storage in CPU as temporary memory spaces for data that needed to be accessed immediately.<br><br>CPU Caches are between CPU registers and RAM, act as fast, small memory in CPU. L1: a few dozens of KB. L2: a few hundred KB. L3: Can be up to a few MB.* |
|  | Router Table, ARP cache, Process Table, Kernel Statistics, Memory (RAM) |
|  | **Temporary file system, Swap space**<br><br>*Swap/pagefile is a portion in the hard disk that serves as virtual memories.* |
|  | Disk, Hard drives |
|  | Remote logging and monitoring data |
|  | Physical Configuration, Network Topology |
| Lowest | Archival media |


**Non-repudiation**: Proof of data integrity and origin of data.
- Know that the data is the same with what is intended when sent. (Integrity)
- Also know who the sender is. (Origin of data)
- Achieved by **Message Authentication Code (MAC)**
	- Two parties share one code and the two can verify each other.
- Digital Signature is for public verification.
	- Anyone can use the public key to verify the private-key-signed document.
