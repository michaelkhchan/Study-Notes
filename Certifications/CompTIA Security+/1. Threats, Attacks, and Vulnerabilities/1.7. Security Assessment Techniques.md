##### Threat Hunting
---
**Intelligence fusion**: Correctly aggregate different data

**Maneuvers**: Employ different defences in difference areas.

**Private IP addresses**:
- 192.168.x.x
- 10.x.x.x
- 172.16-32.x.x

##### Vulnerability Scans
---
**Intrusive vs Non-Intrusive**: 
- Non-intrusive scan: only scan for vulnerability, but won't actively exploit them
- Intrusive scan: will further exploit to see how far one can go

**Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)**: From 0 to 10 scale.
- Calculator: [NVD - CVSS v3 Calculator (nist.gov)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator)

**Misconfigurations**: 
- NFS (Network File System) File Share is open to public
	- NFS allows sharing of directories & files with others over a network
- Guess Access

**Banner Grabbing**: Gain information on OS / services / Port in use. Faster and easier way than vscan.

##### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) System
---
**Syslog**: Standards for message logging.
- SIEM usually have a central syslog collector

**User and Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA)**: identify insider threats or compromised accounts

**Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR)**: Automate routine and time intensive activities between various people and systems.
- Orchestration: Managing, connecting and integrating multiple security systems. Streamlining the security processes.
- Compare with SIEM, SOAR additionally and automatically response to security incidents
