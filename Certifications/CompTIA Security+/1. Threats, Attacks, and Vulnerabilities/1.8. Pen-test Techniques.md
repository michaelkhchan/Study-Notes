##### Reconnaissance
---
**Passive footprinting**: Learning as much as possible from open source. May need a bit of digging.
- E.g., dumpster diving, Asking in online forums
- Publicly accessible information.
- Without interacting with the target.
- Network sniffing is passive, but installing the network tap is not.

**Active footprinting**: Actively testing around. Will be visible to others and even the target.
- E.g., Ping, port scans, DNS query to the local DNS servers, nmap.

**OSINT**: Information already available online.

**Wardriving / Warflying**: Learning about Wi-Fi networks by driving / using a drone to fly around the target to gain information or even perform attacks.


##### Security Teams
---
**White Team**: Referee in a security exercise, not on red or blue.
- Enforcing rules between a purple team exercise.
- Also responsible for wrapping up, lesson-learnt, post-engagement assessments and reporting results.
