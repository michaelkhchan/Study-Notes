##### Malwares
---
**Virus vs. Worm**: Viruses need human intervention for reproduction, while worms do not.

**Boot sector viruses**: Infect the boot sector (the disk section reversed for OS boot)

**Crypto-malware**: Encrypt your files. (Basically modern malware. Usually ransomware.)

**PUP (Potentially Unwanted Program)**: May not be malware, but can be something like pop up ads.

**Remote Access Trojans (RATs)**: Remote admin tools - super backdoors.

**Rootkit**: Modify your kernel (core system files) -> hard to detect by Antivirus.
- Root means root user/admin privileges (highest privilege)
- Secure Boot (UEFI): Check if kernel is changed ->Wont boot modified system

**Command and Control (C&C) servers**: control botnets.

**Logic Bomb**: Wait for a pre-defined event to trigger the application.
- can be time-based / event-based

##### **Password Attack**
---
**Spraying Attack**: Only attempt the most common passwords (e.g. 5) for each account to avoid getting locked out.
- While brute force attack attempt many different passwords on the same account, spraying attack attempt many accounts with the same passwords.

**Credential Stuffing**: Used known credential pairs to attempt different sites/apps.
- Different from the previous twos, credential stuffing focus on attempting many websites/applications with the same credential pairs (username + known password).

**Cognitive password Attacks**: Knowledge-based password like name + birthday, or question about personal information.

##### **Physical attacks**
---
**Malicious USB cable & Flash Drive**: Bad USB.

**Skimming**: Copy credit card data from the magnetic stripe.


##### AI Attacks
---
**Tainted training data**: AI poisoning attack.


##### Supply Chain Attack
---
**Supply Chain Attack**: Instead of directly attack the target, attack the suppliers (e.g. software vendors), as they are usually trusted by the target

##### Cryptographic Attacks
---
**Birthday Attack**: Exploiting hash collisions of large groups of plaintexts. A type of brute forcing.
- Hash collision is when two plaintexts create the same hash.
- Solution: Longer output hash value.

**Downgrade Attack**: on-path attack to convince both sides in using weaker encryption methods.
