##### Weak Configuration
---
**Weak Encryption**: less than 128bits, outdated hash.
- Weak: MD5, DES, RC2, RC4, Blowfish, SHA1, ECB
- Good: AES (over 128 bits), 3DES (ok la)
- TLS has over 300 cypher suite to choose from, so usually will have people choosing the weaker algos.

**Unsecure Protocols**: Message sent in plain text.
- Unsecure: Telnet, FTP, SMTP, IMAP, HTTP
- Secure: SSH, SFTP, IMAPS, HTTPS
