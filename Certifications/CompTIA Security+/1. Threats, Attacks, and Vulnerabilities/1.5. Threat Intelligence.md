- DOS: physically disrupt the systems.

##### Threat Intelligence
---
**Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS)**: Standards for sharing threat data

- **Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX)**: JSON object that contains 18 domain objects

- **Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII)**: Application protocol for exchanging threat intelligence over HTTPS. (Mostly STIX, but also okay for other formats)


**Indicators of Compromise (IOC):** 
- Account based: Observe how an account performs. (e.g., failed login)
- Host based: Observe how the host (computer) runs. (e.g., malicious processes)
