This is my notes for the CompTIA Security+. I mostly only made notes on things that I am not 100% certain or is completely new to me, therefore it may not be fully covering the [exam objectives](https://www.comptia.jp/pdf/CompTIA%20Security+%20SY0-601%20Exam%20Objectives%20(3.0).pdf).

I mainly used Professor Messer's videos, alongside a lot of Google Searches, for my exam preparation, so some of the points may be similar to or even copied from Professor Messer's notes. You can check out his videos and notes [here](https://www.professormesser.com/).
