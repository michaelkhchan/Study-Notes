##### Identity Controls
---
**Identity Provider (IdP)**: Authentication as a service by third party.
- Related standards: SAML, OAuth, OpenID Connect

SSH key-based authentication: Use public private keys instead of usernames and passwords in SSH connections.
- `ssh-keygen` - Create public private key pairs
- `ssh-copy-id user@host` - Copy the public key to the SSH server. Private key is in the local machine.
- `ssh user@host` - Will directly log you in after the previous processes, as the SSH server has the public key and can automatically authenticate with your private key in the local machine.
