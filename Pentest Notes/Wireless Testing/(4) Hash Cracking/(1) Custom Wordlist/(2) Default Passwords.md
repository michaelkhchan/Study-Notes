### Default Passwords
---
##### IEEE Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI):
- [Wireshark · OUI Lookup Tool](https://www.wireshark.org/tools/oui-lookup.html)
The first 3 bytes of the BSSID may provide information such as model number, manuals, etc. We can then look up online to see if there are default passwords or patterns.

> [!note]
> Always consider default passwords too. There may be patterns or methodologies used by a manufacturer in setting the default passwords.
> 
> E..g, TP-Link routers often come with an 8-digit passphrase. Xoom and Arris cable modems use default passphrase patterns as well.
