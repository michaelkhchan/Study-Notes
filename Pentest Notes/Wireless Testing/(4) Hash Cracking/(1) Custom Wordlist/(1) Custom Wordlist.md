### John
---
JTR contains customizable rules for expanding a wordlist.

###### The default wordlist:
```
/usr/share/john/password.lst
```

###### Expand wordlist with custom rules:
To expand the wordlist with custom rules, we can edit the config file:
```sh
sudo mousepad /etc/john/john.conf
```

Under `[List.Rules:Wordlist]`, we can customize the rules, e.g.,:
```
# Add two numbers to the end of each password
$[0-9]$[0-9]
$[0-9]$[0-9]$[0-9]
```

###### To use the new wordlist:
```sh
john --wordlist=/usr/share/john/password.lst --rules --stdout
```
- Use `| grep -i` together to extract specific words.

###### To crack the handshake:
```sh
john --wordlist=/usr/share/john/password.lst --rules --stdout | aircrack-ng -e <AP essid> -w - <.cap file>
```
- Piping the John wordlist output with Aircrack-ng.

### Crunch
---
Crunch would generate all possible combinations of characters. Only 2 parameters are needed - minimum length & maximum length.
```
crunch 8 9
```

###### Specific character sets
To refine the wordlist, we can supply the 3rd parameter - what characters to be included:
```
crunch 8 9 abc123
```
- This will generate all possible combinations between the 6 characters in 8 & 9 digits.

###### Specific patterns
For specific patterns, use the `-t` handle:
```
crunch 11 11 -t password%%%
```
OR
```
crunch 11 11 -t 123456 password@@@
```

| Character | Representation                                                             |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@`       | Lowercase characters OR<br>Characters from the defined set (3rd parameter) |
| `,`       | Uppercase characters                                                       |
| `%`       | Numbers                                                                    |
| `^`       | Symbols                                                                    |
###### Shuffling specific character sets
Use the `-p` handle to shuffle all combinations from the supplied character set (same length).
```
crunch 1 1 -p abcde12345
```
- Example output: `b42d15cea3`.

Or:
```
crunch 1 1 -p dog cat bird
```
- Example output: `catdogbird`.

Or combining with `-t`:
```
crunch 5 5 -t ddd%% -p dog cat bird
```
- Example output: `birdcatdog01`.

The resulting wordlist can be huge, but we can pipe them into crackers directly.

### RSMangler
---
Wordlist Mangler in Ruby. Can generate 6000 passwords just from 3 phrases.

We can generate new combinations from a wordlist:
```
rsmangler --file wordlist.txt
```

###### Saving the Ouput:
Use `--output` to save the output to a file.
```
rsmangler --file wordlist.txt --output mangled.txt
```

###### Saving Memory Usage:
Use `--allow-duplicates` to remove duplicate checks and release memory:
```
rsmangler --file wordlist.txt --allow-duplicates
```

###### Piping wordlist into RSMangler:
```
cat wordlist.txt | rsmangler --file -
```
- Use `-` to accepted piped input.

###### Control password length:
Use `--min` and `--max` to limit the length of the generated passwords.
```
rsmangler --file wordlist.txt --min 12 --max 13
```
