- Not maintained anymore. Still useful in some ways.

Install with:
```sh
sudo apt install cowpatty
```

##### Rainbow Table Mode
To start with, generate hashes for our ESSID alongside with a dictionary file:
```sh
genpmk -f /usr/share/john/password.lst -s <ESSID> -d <output file name>
```
- `-f` for wordlist.
- `-s` for ESSID.
- `-d` for output to a file.

###### Attack:
```sh
cowpatty -r <.cap capture file> -d <generated hash file> -s <ESSID>
```
