### Aircrack-ng
---
##### Cracking with Wordlist:
```sh
aircrack-ng -w <wordlist> -e <ESSID> -b <BSSID> <.cap capture file>
```
- Aircrack-ng cracks with CPU.

###### To confirm if the cracked password is correct:
- It is possible that the captured handshake is an unsuccessful login attempt. To confirm the password, we can try to decrypt other traffics with `airdecap-ng`.
```sh
airdecap-ng -b <BSSID> -e <ESSID> -p <Cracked Password> <.cap capture file>
```
