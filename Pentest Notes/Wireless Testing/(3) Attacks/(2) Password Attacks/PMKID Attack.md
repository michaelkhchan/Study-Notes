### Introduction
---
Access points will stored PMKID sent from a device to skip the 4-way handshakes for faster authentication.

PMKID is a hash created from:
- Wi-Fi Passphrase
- Wi-Fi SSID
- Length of SSID
- MAC of Access Point & Device
- PMK Name
Which only the Wi-Fi Passphrase is unknown - thus brute force-able if we can capture a PMKID hash.


Conditions:
- Routers have to have roaming feature enabled or present.

Tools for attacking:
- hcxdumptool (for capturing PMKID)
- hcxpcaptool (for converting the captured file into hashcat-able file)
