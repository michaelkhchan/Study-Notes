### `iwlist`
---
Allows for the initiation of scanning, listing frequencies, bit rates, and encryption keys.

Listing available channels & frequencies:
```sh
sudo iwlist wlan0 frequency
```

### `iw`
---
`iw` is the new tool to configure Wi-Fi devices. (`iwconfig` is depreciated.)

###### To list detailed information of the wireless interface:
```sh
sudo iw list
```

###### To list available networks:
```sh
sudo iw dev wlan0 scan | grep SSID:
```
- This will list out all information of available networks (Which is a lot)
- Use `grep` to only extract the Wi-Fi names instead.

###### To list available networks with their respective channels:
```sh
sudo iw dev wlan0 scan | egrep "DS Parameter set|SSID:"
```
- `egrep` is used to perform conditional search (using the OR operator (`|`) without needing to escape this special character.

###### To setup Monitor mode:
```sh
sudo iw dev wlan0 interface add wlan0mon type monitor && sudo ip link set wlan0mon up
```

Then use the `iw dev info` command to inspect the new interface:
```sh
sudo iw dev wlan0mon info
```

###### To remove Monitor mode:
```sh
sudo iw dev wlan0mon interface del
```

### `rfkill`
---
`rfkill` can enable or disable connected wireless devices.

###### List all enabled Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices on the system:
```sh
sudo rfkill list
```
- This will output the devices with ID.
- Use `sudo rfkill list [ID]` to list specific devices.

###### Block specific device:
```sh
sudo rfkill block <ID>
```

###### Unblock specific device:
```sh
sudo rfkill unblock <ID>
```

###### Block all devices:
```sh
sudo rfkill block all
```

###### Unblock all devices:
```sh
sudo rfkill unblock all
```
