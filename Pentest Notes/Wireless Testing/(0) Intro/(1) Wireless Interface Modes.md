### Introduction
---
All packets can be captured from the wireless device within range even without connecting.

Wireless Interface Card (WIC) has 2 modes of operations:
- Managed Mode
- Monitor Mode

### Managed Mode
---
Default mode of WIC. Receive data / packet whose destination MAC is similar to the device's MAC, i.e., only capturing packets targeted towards them.

### Monitor Mode
---
Main mode for Wi-Fi hacking. Can capture all packets within range.

### Using Wi-Fi Adapter & Changing mode in Kali:
---
##### 1. Plug in the USB Adapter:
In VMware or VirtualBox, connect to this newly plugged in device in settings (Removable Device).

We can check if `wlan0` pops out in ifconfig.
```
ifconfig
```

##### 2. Check the mode of the WIC:
This command will show the detail of wireless connections, including the mode they are running.
```
iwconfig
```

##### 3. Change the mode:
Run this command to change the mode of `wlan0` to monitor:
```
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
```
- The interface name should be changed to `wlan0mon` if we use `ipconfig` again.

Use this command to revert it back to managed mode:
```
sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
```
