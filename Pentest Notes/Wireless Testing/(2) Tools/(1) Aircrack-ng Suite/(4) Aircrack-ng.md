### Aircrack-ng
---
Use to crack WEP & WPA networks.

### Syntax
---
##### Cracking captured keys:
```sh
aircrack-ng -w <wordlist> <handshake capture (.cap)>
```
- WPA requires a wordlist to crack.
- While WEP does not require a wordlist, it requires a large number (>10k) of packets captured to retrieving the password.

##### CPU Benchmarking:
```sh
aircrack-ng -S
```


### Alternatives
---
#### Hashcat:
Hashcat supports GPU-based WPA2 cracking, which is much faster:

- [Cracking WPA/WPA2 Pre-shared Key Using GPU - Brezular's Blog](https://brezular.com/2021/07/01/cracking-wpa-wpa2-pre-shared-key-using-gpu/)
It requires additional tools: `hcxdumptool` & `hcxpcapngtool`.
