### Introduction
---
All-in-one automated Wireless attack tool that runs most existing tools (e.g., `airmon-ng`,`aircrack-ng`, etc.)

### Basic Syntax
---
```sh
sudo wifite [options]
```

| Options                     | Details                          |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `--wep` / `--wpa` / `--wes` | Show only the specified networks |

The tool will automatically:
1. Change your Wi-Fi adapter to monitor mode. (Without needing to use `airmon-ng`)
2. Scan nearby networks (Clients & Targets)
	- Client refers to a device connected to the Wi-Fi
	- Targets refers to the Wi-Fi Access Point (the router)
3. Attack the target once selected

Use `Ctrl+C` to stop scanning and choose targets to attack.

`ESSID`: Name of the network
`CH`: Wi-Fi Channels (Related to Coverage only) ([Read this for more](https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/connectivity/wifi-ieee-802-11/channels-frequencies-bands-bandwidth.php))
`ENCR`: Encryption Methods (e.g., WEP, WPA, etc.)
`PWR`: Power - how strong is the signal.
`WPS`: If WPS is enabled - Can use WPS attacks.


Use the following 2 commands if install for the first time:
```sh
sudo apt install hcxtools && sudo apt install hcxdumptool
```
- Run `sudo apt update` if packages cannot be located.


### Dictionary Attacks
---
```sh
sudo wifite --dict <wordlist>
```
- The default wordlist will be used if path is not provided.

After the handshake is captured, it will start to crack the handshake file with wordlist by using `aircrack-ng`.
