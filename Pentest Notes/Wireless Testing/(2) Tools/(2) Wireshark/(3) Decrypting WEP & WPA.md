### Decrypting Captures
---
We have to check `Enable decryption` and provide `decryption keys`. To do this, we can click on `Edit...` located to the right of `Decryption keys`.

##### WEP:
To add a WEP key, select `wep` in the Key type, then fill in the Key field with the WEP key in hexadecimal. Separate each byte with a colon for better clarity.

##### WPA:
TheÂ `wpa-pwd` is for WPA passphrases. The format is `PASSPHRASE:ESSID`.
- We can also omit the ESSID to attempt to decrypt all network with the passphrase.

The `wpa-psk`, allows us to enter the hexadecimal Pairwise Master Key (PMK). This is useful when decrypting WPA1/2 Enterprise packets, when using PSK and the ESSID, or when the passphrase contains a colon (:) character.

To generate the PMK, we can use `wpa_passphrase`:
```
wpa_passphrase [SSID] [Passphrase]
```
