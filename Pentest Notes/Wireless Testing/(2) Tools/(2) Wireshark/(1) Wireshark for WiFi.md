### Introduction
---
Before using WireShark for Wi-Fi, we first have to set the WIC to monitor mode to capture only wireless frames:
```
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
```

In the frontpage of Wireshark, only choose `wireless` in the filter dropdown menu at the top right side.

###### To start the capture:
1. Double Click on the interface, or
2. Select the interface and click on the shark fin at the top left corner. The fin will turn blue once we selected an interface.

###### Wireless Toolbar:
There is a wireless toolbar in "View".


###### To scan all channels of 2.4GHz:
As Wireshark don't channel hop by default, we have to run this script in the background:
```
for channel in 1 6 11 2 7 10 3 8 4 9 5
do
  iw dev wlan0mon set channel ${channel}
  sleep 1
done
```
OR
```
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
```


### Filters
---
As Beacon frames are not useful when looking at Wireless traffic, then can be filtered out.
```
not subtype beacon
```

### Command Line Tool
---
###### List all interfaces with index number:
```
sudo wireshark -D
```

###### Start Wireshark Capture GUI:
```
sudo wireshark -i wlan0mon -k
```
or 
```
sudo wireshark -i wlan -I -k
```
- `-I` for enabling monitor mode.

Add filters:
```
sudo wireshark -i wlan0mon -k -f "[Filter rules]"
```

Only capture the first few bytes for each frame:
```
sudo wireshark -i wlan0mon -k -s 60
```
- `-s` for bytes of frames.

Open PCAP files:
```
wireshark wifi.pcap
```
