### Loading & Unloading Wireless Drivers
---
###### Determine the WIC's driver:
```sh
sudo airmon-ng
```
- Look for the driver name & the chipset

###### Examine the USB devices:
```sh
sudo lsusb -vv
```
- Shows detailed information of a USB device, including product id, chipset etc.

###### Display the details of a driver:
```sh
sudo modinfo <driver name>
```
- Drivers are located in `/lib/modules/[kernel version]`

###### Modify parameters of a driver:
```sh
sudo modprobe <driver name> <parameter>=<value>
```
- E.g., `sudo modprobe ath9k_htc blink=0` to disable blinking
- No output will be displayed if there is no error.

###### Unloading a driver:
```sh
sudo modprobe -r <driver name 1> <driver name 2>...
```
- If a driver has dependencies (i.e., it is using other drivers), the dependencies must be unloaded first to unload the driver.
- Use `lsmod` to show what drivers/modules are loaded.

###### Loading a driver from the default kernel library:
```sh
sudo modprobe <driver name>
```
- Default kernel directory: `/lib/modules/[kernel version]`

From specific path
```sh
sudo insmod <driver path>
```
