### Network Interface

> [!important]
> Directly installing Kali from the ISO Installer images may cause the Wi-Fi adapter to not work (mostly due to configuration issues). Use the Pre-built Kali VM images instead ([Get Kali | Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines))

###### Issues I have encountered:
- I was running Kali on VirtualBox with an ISO image installation from scratch.
- The Wi-Fi adapter was connected to the VM and showed up in `ifconfig` as `wlan0`.
- However, the `Available networks` of Wi-Fi network at the top right corner of Kali is greyed out. The adapter also cannot detect any networks nearby.\
- Switching to a prebuilt Kali VM image successfully solved the issue.
- Also just try to plug & unplug for a few times.

### VirtualBox
---
Go to Device -> USB -> Tick the Wi-Fi adapter

### VMWare
---
Go to VM -> Removable Devices -> Wi-Fi adapter -> Connect
