### Introduction

Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). First attempt to encrypt wireless data to prevent MITM. Easily exploitable nowadays.

##### Key Features:
- Using a 64-bit or 128-bit hexadecimal static key.
- As static key is used, all devices across the same network uses the same single key.
	- Problem: Can be brute forced.


An access point has to authenticate a client before it can communicate with the network. Two types of WEP authentications:

**1. Open System Authentication (OSA)**
- Does not require any key. 

**2. Shared Key Authentication (SKA)**
- Requires the AP and the client to have the same WEP key to authenticate.
