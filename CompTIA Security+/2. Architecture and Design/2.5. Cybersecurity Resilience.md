##### Disk Redundancy
---
**Redundancy of Independent Disk (RAID)**: combine multiple physical harddisk into one virtual harddisk.
- Also name as Inexpensive, as compared to one single big expensive harddisk.
- RAID Levels:
	- **RAID 0**: distributing volumes into each disk. Lose one disk = lose all files (basically acts like one big disk)
	- **RAID 1**: Mirroring drives. All drives have the same data, read & write together. Functions normally as long as one disk still working. Require twice the drive space (1TB of space requires 2TB of disks)
	- **RAID 2 & 3**: Use bit and byte level striping respectively. Outdated.
	- **RAID 4**: Block level striping with dedicated parity. Better I/O parallelism than 2&3 as don't have to read all disks every time. One of the drives is used for parity (backup).
	- **RAID 5**: Striping with distributed parity. Parity info is distribute across disks.

##### Network Redundancy
---
**Load Balancer**: A device in the network that will balance the load (traffic) across servers.
- Some servers are active, some are on standby.

**Network Interface Card (NIC) Teaming**: Using multiple network interface cards in a device.
- Also known as Load Balancer Fail Over (LBFO).
- All connected to the internet. Increased bandwidth for input and output.
- Combine multiple network adapters to look like a single adapter. Integrated with switch settings to interpret all traffics going through as the same traffic.
- NICs will use multicast to communicate with each other to see if anyone fails

##### Replication
---
**Storage Area Networks (SANs)**: a dedicated network for data storage connecting to multiple servers.

##### Backup Types
---
**Archive Attribute**: an attribute of a object in Windows. Will be ticked when a file is modified.

**Full Backup**: Backup everything in a system. After full backup, all Archive attribute is cleared (unticked), indicated everything is already backed up and at the latest version.

**Incremental Backup**: Only backup data that has been changed since the last incremental backup.
- Incremental = increasing on, adding on, step by step. Each time only backup the new data.
- After an initial full backup, an incremental backup will only backup new/modified data.
- Suppose the user add 1 file on Monday, and add 2 other files on Tuesday.
- If an incremental backup is performed on Monday, only the 1 extra file will be backed up in this backup copy.
- When performed on Tuesday, as the Monday file was already backed up in the Monday backup, this backup will only backup the 2 new files added on Tuesday.
- Therefore, the Monday and Tuesday backups does not contains the same file.

**Differential Backup**: Backup data that has been changed since the last FULL backup.
- Differential = difference between the current data and the full backup
- This means that if a differential backup is performed on Monday, the Monday backup will have the 1 extra file.
- When performed on Tuesday, the Tuesday differential backup will have both the Monday file AND the 2 new files on Tuesday, making it 3 files backed up in total.
- In other words, the newer differential backup always contains files from the older differential backups.

**NAS vs SAN:** 
- **Network Attached Storage (NAS)**: File-level storage server connecting to a network.
	- File-level = modifying a part of a large file requires overwriting the whole file. Slow.	
	- Often arranged in the RAID format. Usually runs in a stripped OS (limited functionality).
	- Provides both storage and a file system. Looks like a file server to clients.
	- Connects via Ethernet network. Usually just a single device connected to the network.
	- Less expensive and easier to set up.


- **Storage Area Network (SAN)**: Block-level storage. High-performance and Low-latency.
	- Block-level: Can just modify a part of a large file without rewrite the whole file.
	- Separates from the LAN. Doesn't interfere with regular traffics.
	- Provides storages only. Looks like a directly local connected hard disks (super fast).
	- Connects via Fibre Channel (光纖通道). A network of multiple storage devices.
	- More expensive and harder to set up.

##### Resiliency
---
**Non-persistence**: Making a system/application temporarily available when used only. 
- When not in use, remove the system to reduce on-time and attack surface for attackers.
- Use backups (images, snapshots, configurations) or live boot medias to restart the system when needed.


##### Power Redundancy
---
**High Availability (HA)**: Minimize downtime for critical systems.
