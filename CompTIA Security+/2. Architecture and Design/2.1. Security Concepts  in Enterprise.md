##### Configuration Management
---
**Diagrams**: Figures that map the physical / network connections and layout of systems and devices
- It can even be individual device's cable configurations.

**Baseline Configuration**: Lowest requirements for all devices/systems


##### Site Resiliency
---
**Hot site**: Fully operational site with company data in it already.

**Warm site**: Fully operational site without company data.

**Cold site**: Site that can be used when main site is down. Usually only contains basic hardware & supply.

##### Data Protection
---
**Data Sovereignty**: Data in a country/region is legally abided to the local law.
- E.g., EU: GDPR -> EU citizen data must be stored in the EU.

**Data Encryption**: Encrypt data to pseudo-random, unreadable data.
- Confusion: Encrypted data should be drastically different from the plaintext
- Diffusion: Changing one character in the input will drastically change the output

**Tokenization:** Replacing sensitive data with a non-sensitive code. ^2c1ec4
- Not hashing nor encryption, as no mathematical calculation was included. Simply using another name for the sensitive data.

**Information Rights Management (IRM)**: Technology that protect sensitive documents from unauthorized access
- Applies to documents, spreadsheets, presentations, etc.
- Prevents unauthorized copying, viewing, printing, deleting, editing, forwarding, etc.

**Data Lost Prevention (DLP)**: System that stop data loss.
- Endpoint: personal devices, or on Networks, or on Servers.
- Allowing or denying certain tasks, e.g., block USB from transfer data.
- All attack vectors, such as email, physical devices, network, etc.

##### SSL/TLS Security
---
**SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) & TLS (Transport Layer Security)**: Protocol for secure communication. ^d0a553
- TLS is essentially the latest version of SSL. (Certs are still named as SSL due to convention).
- Used in HTTPS.
- How does SSL/TLS work:
	- Browser contains a list of trusted root Certificate Authorities (CAs) & their public keys.
	- A webpage should also contains its SSL certificate issued by the above CAs.
	- When visiting a webpage, the browser will see if the SSL certificate of the page is legitimate by checking with its list of CA and public keys.
	- If the certificate is shown to be signed by one of the CAs, then it is good to go.
- When expired, trust is reduced but communication is still encrypted (just like self-signed certificates)

**SSL/TLS Inspection / Proxy**: Adding a proxy between the user and the webpage to inspect the originally secured and encrypted SSL/TLS communication.
- Setting up a device/firewall between webpage and browser.
- First, the firewall will create its own internal SSL certificates, and also install them in all browsers in the local network. This way all browsers can build secured SSL/TLS connection with the proxy.
- Second, the firewall will establish an actual SSL/TLS connection with the webpage. By doing so, the firewall effectively received the decrypted data and encrypt them again when sending to the browsers.

- ***How to avoid***: Certificate Pinning.
##### Deception & Disruption
---
**Fake Telemetry**: 
- Telemetry is the remote collection and automatic transmission of data to receiving device. It is commonly used to train AI models due to the ease of collection large volume of data.
- Fake telemetry is therefore the manipulation of training data from attackers to mislead AI models thinking malicious software is legitimate. Basically poisoning attack.

**DNS Sinkhole**: A DNS that gives the incorrect IP address.
- For attackers, it can be used to redirect users to malicious pages.
- For defenders, it can be used to redirect already known malicious domains to another safe IP.
	- We can also see which users clicked on the malicious domain to see if they are infected or compromised.
