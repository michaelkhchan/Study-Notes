##### Cryptography Concepts
---
**Key Stretching**: Making a short (and weak) key stronger by increasing the resource needed to brute force
- e.g., Hashing three times, making brute force way harder as one would have to triple its attacks to find out the plaintext. 
- bcrypt: use the Blowfish cypher to perform multiple rounds of hashing.
- Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2): Provide derived key from password with salt and repeated hashing.

**Homomorphic Encryption (HE)**: A form of encryption that allows computation on encrypted data without having to first decrypt it.
- Avoid processing data in the clear.
- Homomorphism = structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures
	- Preserves operations. Thus mathematical operations on the encrypted data should be the same on operating on the decrypted data.

##### Symmetric and Asymmetric Cryptography
---
**Key exchange**: A way to create a secret key for symmetric encryption with another person without having to actually send the secret key across the network.
- Mostly known as ***Diffie–Hellman key exchange***.
	- First, Alice and Bob can publicly agree on the same starting numbers for a specific function.
		- In the paint analogy, this is the same colour paint (yellow).
	- Then, they can add their own respective secret key into the function to create their public keys.
		- Alice's secret key is red, the resulting public key will then be red + yellow = orange.
		- Bob's secret key is blue, the resulting public key will then be blue + yellow = green.
	- Next, Alice and Bob will exchange their respective public keys in the public.
		- So a external actor will see orange, green, and the starting yellow paint.
		- However, it should be expensive to extract the original secret colour just from the above 3 colours. In real life, it would be numbers that are extremely large.
	- Lastly, Alice and Bob will add in their secret key into the received public key. This will create a common secret key at both sides.
		- For Alice, she receives Green. Green + Red = Brown
		- For Bob, he receives Orange. Orange + Blue = Brown

**Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC)**: Use curves instead of large numbers for encryption. Provide same level of security as non-ECC cryptography using smaller keys.
- Next generation of public key cryptography. Low cost and fast. Good for IOT.
- An elliptic curve is a set of points that satisfy a specific mathematical equation like this $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$ 
- Much more scalable than traditional encryptions like RSA. (Trapdoor function: Easy in one direction, Hard to reverse)
	- For the number of the same size, solving ECC is much harder than factoring (commonly used in traditional encryption). 
- In short, the starting point, ending point and the curve will be public. The private key here is how many times does the starting point need to bounce across the curve to the ending point. 
	- It is impossible to directly deduce from the ending point. One can only brute force and start from the beginning.


**Symmetric Algorithms:** 
- AES
- DES, 3DES
- TwoFish, BlowFish,
- RC4 (Only stream cipher, others all block cipher)

**Outputs:**
- SHA1: 160 bits
- SHA2: 256 bits
- NTML: 128 bits
- MD-5: 128 bits


##### Hashing and Digital Signature
---
**Digital Signature**: Use private key to encrypt the hash of the plaintext one is sending.
- Only the corresponding known public key can decrypt the message.
- Moreover, as the digital signature is a hash of the plaintext, one can then check to see if the plaintext has been modified.

##### Cryptographic Keys
---
**Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)**: Use a different (ephemeral) session key for exchange every time.
- Instead of sharing the same symmetric key each time, use an one-time session key each time.
- Even when future keys are hacked, previous conversations cannot be decrypted.
- Achieved by both parties extra adding random values into the key exchange every time.
	- This way, even when one of the long-term private keys got compromised, hackers cannot decrypt previous session messages as they don't know the every time different random values added to create that ephemeral session key.

**One-time Pad**: Truly unbreakable encryption. However, both party must have a pre-shared random key that is used once only.


##### Stream Ciphers and Block Ciphers
---
**Stream Ciphers**: Encrypt data byte by byte. Mostly used in symmetric encryption only. Useful in streaming data.
- The symmetric key is infinitely extended into a keystream. Therefore the key is not required to be the same length as the plaintext. 
- Each digit in the plaintext is encrypted with the corresponding digit of the keystream, one at a time.

**Block Ciphers**: Encrypt data by block. Often 64 or 128 bit block, encrypt and decrypt independently.
- If a block is not full (64 or 128 bits), paddings will usually be added to fill in the blanks.

**Mode of Block Ciphers:**

- **Electronic Codebook (ECB)**: Simplest encryption mode. (Easy B).
	- Only use one same key to encrypt all blocks.
	- Therefore identical plaintext will generate an identical cipher block.
	- ![[Pasted image 20231206004303.png]]

- **Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)**: Each plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext.
	- XOR: If same bit (e.g., 1 from plaintext block and 1 from "key" block), then result is 0. If different bit (1 & 0), then result is 1. The result will be a series of number that differs from the plaintext a lot. One can only use the key to reverse the procedure and retrieve the plaintext from the ciphered text.
	- In CBC, the previous ciphered block is used to XOR with the next plaintext block. This will result in a completely unrecognisable text block from the original plaintext. Also, this added randomness will also allow same plaintext blocks to yield different ciphertext.
	- ![[Pasted image 20231206041830.png]]

- **Counter (CTR)**: Use a counter as initialization vector.
	- As the counter will grow larger every operation, each encryption will be different even with the same plaintext. (e.g., Plaintext & 001 v.s. Plaintext & 002)
	- Instead of encrypting the plaintext, this method uses the key to encrypt the counter, and use the plaintext to perform the XOR after encrypting the counter.

**Galois Counter Mode (GCM)**: Combination of Counter and Galois authentication.
- Apart from the encrypted payload, it will also generate an authentication tag (most likely a hash) for one to check if the payload has been modified.
- Used in network traffic security (e.g., IPsec)
- Also used in SSH and SSL/TLS.
