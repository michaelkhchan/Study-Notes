##### Cloud Models
---
**Managed Service Providers (MSP)**:  Basically outsourcing the management & execution of a range of process and functions to cut cost.
- Providing Cloud service is one of them, but not all of them.
- **MSSP** - Managed Security Service Providers. 

##### Cloud Computing
---
**Edge Computing**: Computing network architecture where "computing" is moved as close to the source of data as possible to reduce latency & bandwidth usage.
- E.g., Instead of going to a remote server, calculations will be perform in the local IOT device.

**Fog Computing**: Midpoint between Edge & Cloud. A distributed cloud architecture.
- Local decisions can stay local if no extra information or process is needed.
- Fog/Nodes are at the middle between edges & cloud. Can perform real time processing and basic analysis. Also act as caches and buffer between edges and cloud.
- Move non-sensitive data to the cloud for longer term analysis / other usages.

##### Cloud Architecture
---
**Thin Client**: A just-strong-enough computer that can connect to the cloud computer.
- Also refers to Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI).
- Merely have enough processing power to connect to the remote server where apps are actually running.
- Just need a keyboard, mouse and monitor.

**Microservice Architecture and API**: Application with modular microservices, usually connected & communicate through APIs.
- Scalable & Resilience to individual service outages.

**Serverless Architecture**: Function-as-a-service (FaaS). No OS is needed. Functions run on a stateless compute container.
- A stateless container means that it won't retain session state from previous connections -> one-time connection only. Need to start over again if reconnect.
- Usually ran by third parties. Ephemeral & event triggered.

**Transit Gateway**: A cloud router that connects all virtual private cloud (VPC) in a public cloud.
- VPC is a isolated private cloud hosted with a public cloud.
- Transit gateway acts as the router to route traffics out of the cloud to the VPCs.

**Service Integration and Management (SIAM)**: Integration of different service providers.
- Provide a single business solution for clients.


##### Infrastructure as code
---
**Infrastructure as code:** A source template for infrastructure configurations for all present and future machines.
- Descriptive model to define and deploy infrastructure, such as network, VMs, load balancers and connection topologies. Generates the same environment every time it deploys.

- **Software-defined networking (SDN)**: Controlling network traffic using software-based controllers / APIs instead of traditional hardware like routers and switches.
	- Manage all traffic from one panel (Software-based firewall)
  
- **Software-defined visibility (SDV)**: Similar to SDN, but optimized to provide intelligent visibility
	- Aggregate data from all security applications and devices.
	- Provide visibility and real time metrics to traffic flows.


##### Virtualization
---
**Virtual Machine (VM) Sprawl Avoidance**: Avoiding deploying too many VMs and grow into chaos.
- Sprawling: basically spreading out in a mess.
- Should have proper documentation and formal process for deploying VMs.
