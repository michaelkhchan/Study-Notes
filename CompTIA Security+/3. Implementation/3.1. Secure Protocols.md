##### Web
---
**SSL/TLS**: See [[2.1. Security Concepts  in Enterprise#^d0a553|2.1. Security Concepts - SSL/TLS]]
- Application layer (Layer 4 for TCP/TP, Layer 6 for OSI).
- Port 443.

**HTTP Secure / Over SSL (HTTPS)**: Use public key encryption to send over symmetric session key.
- Application layer (Layer 4 for TCP/TP, Layer 7 for OSI).
- Port 443

**Domain Name System Secure (DNSSEC)**: Use public key encryption for DNS.
- DNS records are signed by trusted third parties and published in DNS.
- **DNS**: Port 53.

##### Directory Services
---
**Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)**: Protocols for accessing directories over an IP network.
- Application Layer. (Layer 4 for TCP/IP, Layer 7 for OSI)
- Largely used in Active Directory. Basically a protocol to search stuff within the directory.
	- Not a shared authentication protocol
- **LDAP Secure (LDAPS)**: Run LDAP over SSL/TLS.
	- Use mutual authentication with TLS (Server need certs from client too)
- **Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)**: A common secure framework for many applications.

- LDAP: Port 389
- LDAPS: Port 636

##### Encrypted Tunnel, Routing and Switching
---
**Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)**: A network protocol for securely sending commands remotely over an unsecured network.
- Use TCP for transport layer. Reliable and stable connection. Replace FTP (21) & Telnet (23). (Therefore **port 22**)
- Build a two way secured communication by client and server authenticating each other using certificates (unlike HTTPS, where only the client authenticates the server)
- As so, clients can access the command line of the server, as the server can trust the user.
- SSH Port forwarding: connect to an external facing server, then forward to the internal server.


**Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)**: Authenticates and Encrypts data packets over Internet Protocol (IP)
- Internet/Network Layer (Layer 2 for TCP/IP, Layer 3 for OSI).
- One can choose to perform encryption in the IP (Network layer) level, instead of using SSL/TLS (Transport layer). 
	- IPSec (Network Layer) encrypts the packet, while SSL/TLS encrypts the HTTP traffic (data are converted into ciphertext very early on). Also, SSL/TLS is application-specific, different apps may have different certs. This could allow secure communication within applications, but not encrypting the all traffic (IPSec encrypts all traffic)
- Uses two protocols:
	- **Authentication Header (AH)**: Use to check if packet has been tampered with (Hashing the payload & some of the headers with a shared secret key)
	- **Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP)**: Encrypted payload
- Two modes of Operation:
	- **Transport Mode**: Encrypt the payload only. IP header remain public.
	- ![[Pasted image 20231230095751.png]]
	
	- **Tunnel Mode**: Encrypt the whole packet. Add a new IP header.
		- The packets are sent to the IPSec concentrator at the other end. (VPN)

**Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**: Connect to work desktop computer remotely.
- Mostly used in Microsoft.
- Port 3389



**Simple Network Management Protocol version 3 (SNMPv3)**: a network protocol for querying devices such as routers and switches. Network Monitoring.
- Application layer. (Layer 4 for TCP/IP, Layer 7 for OSI).
- Manage devices like router (at remote sites).
- Version 3 added encryption. 
- Active monitoring of devices.
- Port 161, 162


**Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**: Automatically assign IP addresses to devices connected to the network.
- Application layer (Layer 4 for TCP/IP, Layer 7 for OSI). A client protocol that provide services to host.
- Use UDP for Transport layer. Therefore at least over layer 4.
- Port 67, 68



##### File Transfer
---
**File Transfer Protocol Over SSL (FTPS)**: Use public key encryption for file transfer.
- Application layer (Layer 4 for TCP/TP, Layer 7 for OSI). Communication protocol for transfer of file from server to client.
	- Apparently most modern browsers have dropped support for FTP. Also requires installation of FTP client (stays true for FTPS, as FTPS is just FTP with encryption.)
- FTP: Port 21. (Telnet: Port 23)
- FTPS: Port 443 (SSL/TSL)
- NOT SFTP. FTPS use SSL (asymmetric / public key encryption). Clients have to explicitly request for security from the FTPS server.
- Moreover, FTPS requires complicated firewall configurations and standalone extra certificates (for SSL).
- Cannot act as a file system.

**SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)**: Secure FTP by using SSH
- Application layer (Layer 4 for TCP/TP, Layer 7 for OSI).
	- Replacing FTPS. More secure and better capabilities.
- Usually comes with SSH as part of the implementation.
	- Runs over the standard SSH port (Port 22). No additional ports & authentication needed.
	- Also can utilize the existing SSH certification method.
	- Therefore can implement file systems and remote control files.

##### Mail, Audio and Video
---
**Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP)**: Encrypted network protocol for audio and video.
- Application layer (Layer 4 for TCP/TP, Layer 5, Session Layer, for OSI). Use AES for encryption.
- Typically used in [[2.6. Embedded and Specialized systems#^19871e |Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)]] (Voice call on internet)
	- Remote video/audio call.
- Usually runs over UDP. (No specific port)
- Use HMAC-SHA1 for authentication and prevent replay attacks.
	- Only accept messages that has previously not been received.
	- Use sequence number of packets as the counter.

**Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)**: Public Key encryption for MIME (Internet standard that extends email to support more than ASCII characters, as well as attachments).
- Application layer (Layer 4 for TCP/TP, Layer 6 for OSI).
- MIME is a format for email communications.
	- Typically used in SMTP, POP, IMAP, etc.
- S/MIME: Use digital certificates to encrypt and sign emails transferred.
	- Can integrate public key encryption to most modern email clients.

**Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)**: Connect email clients to server for remote accessing and controlling the mailbox in a server. Will not download email before clicked in.
- **Secure IMAP**: Encrypt with SSL. Port 993.
- Secure IMAP only encrypt emails downloaded from a server, but not out-going emails.
- Port 143

**Post Office Protocol (POP)**: Download emails to the client application and delete those emails from the email server. Basically like post office delivering the package.
- **Secure POP**: Encrypt with STARTTLS extension.
- Port 110

**Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)**: Email protocol. Usually used by email servers.
- Port 25

##### Time Synchronization
---
**Network Time Protocol (NTP)**: A networking protocol for synchronizing time across computers.
- Application layer (Layer 4 for TCP/IP, Layer 7 for OSI).
- **NTPSec**: Secured version of NTP. 
- Port 123
