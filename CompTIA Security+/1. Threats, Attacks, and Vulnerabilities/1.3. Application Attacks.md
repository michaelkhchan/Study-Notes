##### Injection Attacks
---
**XML Injections**: Exploit invalidated XML files that are sent to the server:
``` XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]> 
<stockCheck><productId>&xxe;</productId></stockCheck>
```
- This payload defined `xxe` as `file:///etc/passwd`.


**LDAP Injections**: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. Similar to SQL Injection.
- LDAP - commonly used to store usernames and passwords.
- When a LDAP query is constructed to validate a user's login credentials, a user can inject malicious code into their username or password to either bypass the password authentication, or to force the server to return sensitive user data.

```LDAP
String filter = “(&(USER = ” + user_name + “) (PASSWORD = “ + user_password + “))”;

#Resulting string: (&(USER = user_name) (PASSWORD = user_password))
```
- An attacker can enter a crafted input for the variable `user_name` such as `johnDoe)(&)` and any value for password. 
- The finished query will then become` (&(USER = johnDoe)(&))(PASSWORD = pass))`. Only the first portion of this query is processed by the LDAP server `(&(USER = johnDoe)(&)`, which always evaluates to true, allowing the attacker to gain access to the system without needing to provide valid user credentials.


**DLL Injections**: Dynamic-Link Library. A Windows Library contains code and data.
- DLL was designed as shared codes for different processes. Only a single file is need for multiple processes, and it can be called during runtime and the OS will perform the binding.
- In short, DLL injections are used to load a DLL into the memory of a targeted process (e.g. notepad.exe), which allows attacker to execute codes under the context of the targeted process.


##### Buffer overflows
---
**Buffer overflow**: A section of memory is able to overwrite another section of memory.
- By putting excessive data into one section of memory, it may be possible to spillover to another section of memory, causing it to overwrite its original value.

In the above example, the character "e" in "excessive" has overwritten one block in section B, causing the value to be altered.


##### Replay Attacks
---
**Pass the Hash**: Pass a password hash to the server for authentication. A type of replay attack.
- Does not need to decrypt the hash
- Exploit the fact that passwords hash remains static for every session.


**Sidejacking (Session Hijacking)**: Using a session ID of others.


**How to mitigate:**
- For network level, use SSL for encryption communication -> prevent on-path interception of hash
- Also, introduce Session ID with password hash to create a unique authentication hash each time.
- Use end to end encryption. HTTPS, force-TLS, VPN.


##### Request Forgery
---
**Cross-site request forgery (CSRF / XSRF)**: Exploiting the trust that a website has in a user's browser.

- Usually when a user is logged into a site under the same browser, the session is saved in the browser. Thus, the user does not have to log in every time.
- CSRF exploit this trust of browser from site by submitting unauthorized requests from the user's browser. This way, the site will believe this is a legitimate request from the user side.
- This is usually performed by crafting a link that will send certain request. When the user press on the link, as they are already logged in as their identity, the sent request will looks legitimate.

- Also called "One-Click Attack".

- For the cross-site part, just imagine the crafted link was attached as an <\a> tag button in another domain (e.g., `attacker.com`), and will redirect you to the targeted site (e.g., `GET example.com/delete?id=3`)

**How to mitigate:**
- Check HTTP referer header. If it is not from the authentic site, reject.
- Introduce a hidden value of CSRF token in the request forms. This way only the original form in the authentic site will know the value.
- Double Submit Cookie: Include the secret CSRF token in cookie. This way the request sent from another domain will not be able to include such token in their cookie.

##### Driver Manipulation
---
**Shimming**: Inserting a layer between application and OS to modify the behavior of the application.
- A shim (墊片) is used to fill in the gap between two things.
- In computer language, a shim usually refers to a library that intercepts API calls and changes the application's behavior. 
- In Windows, it is used to allow backward compatibility, where the shims simulate older versions of Windows to allow older applications to work.
- Malware authors can write their own shims that can allow malwares to be introduced into the system.

**Refactoring**: Basically means obfuscation. Introduce random noise or intelligent reordering to create different signatures every time to evade antivirus detection.


##### SSL Stripping
---
**SSL Stripping / HTTP downgrading**: Combining on-path attack & downgrade attack.
- Strips the S away from HTTPS.

![[Pasted image 20231123014009.png]]

- Essentially, the attacker intercepted the HTTP request from the user, and forward the request from its own machine.
- If not configurated to reject HTTP connections, the server may respond to the user to ask to connect in HTTPS. This is of course received by the attacker.
- The attacker then accepts and establishes a HTTPS connection with the server. From now on, it only has to sent back the responses from the server to the user, and reproduces user's requests (that are sent to the attacker).


##### Race Condition
---
**Race Condition**: When two processes attempt to access the same resource at the same time.
- If not consider, it may lead to unexpected outcomes like double count or infinite loop.

**Time-of-check to time-of-use attack (TOCTOU)**: Time difference between checking & using
- Attackers can replace files / inject codes during this time gap to trick the application.


##### Memory-related Vulnerabilities
---
**Memory Leak**: Did not release unused memory -> Uses up all available memory and crashes.

**NULL Pointer dereference**: Force a pointer to point at nothing (NULL) in the memory.
- Causing the application to crash or to display error message

**Integer overflow**: Having a number outside than the defined range (e.g. 10000 for 9999).
- E.g., when goes to -1, may return maximum value instead.

**Resource Exhaustion**: A kind of DOS attacks. 
- Aims to use up all available resources of a system
- e.g., ZIP bomb: 42 kb when zipped, 4500 TB when unzipped.
- e.g. DHCP starvation: flood network with IP address request with different MAC address. Drain all IP from the server.
